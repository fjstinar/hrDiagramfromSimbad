# Simbad Tabular Data -> HR Diagram
This is a simple python script that converts tabular cluster data from the Simbad CDS database into rudimentary Hertzsprung-Russell Diagrams.

**Use:**

1) Go to http://cdsportal.u-strasbg.fr and find a cluster that you wish to plot.
2) Download the Simbad Tabular Data as a csv.
3) Put the file in the same directory as 'HRDiagrammer.py'
4) Run HRDiagrammer with Python 3 in the command line with the downloaded csv:
~~~
python3 HRDiagrammer.py 'nameOfCsv.csv'
~~~
